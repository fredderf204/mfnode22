This is a demo Node Web applcation that can be deployed to an Azure Web App.

It is built with Node, Express and EJS.

It also allows for a customised deploy through the use of the deploy.sh and .deployment files. This process is descibed here; https://github.com/projectkudu/kudu/wiki/Custom-Deployment-Script.

I have added a step in the deployment to run additonal build tasks through Grunt (other tools can be used i.e. Gulp).
